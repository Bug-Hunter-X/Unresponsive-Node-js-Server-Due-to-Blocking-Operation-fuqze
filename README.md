This repository demonstrates a common Node.js issue: blocking the event loop with a synchronous operation in a request handler.  The `bug.js` file shows a server that becomes unresponsive because of a computationally intensive loop in the main thread.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a solution using asynchronous operations to prevent blocking.
